Medical tube is a kind of common consumable in hospital around the world, including Hong Kong and China Mainland. As the key elements of biomedical instruments, medical tube is capable of connecting the apparatuses to transport medical solutions and biofluids (e.g., blood, urine, and interstitial fluid), or building a channel between the vein and the drug solution for intravenous infusion. However, the conventional tube suffers from the limitation of lack of directional transport .
